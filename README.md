# NPM Prepare Dist CLI

> Clean and prepare `dist` folder and all files before publishing your NPM library
>
> - Potentially smaller build and faster installation of your library
> - TypeScript, JavaScript, CLI version
> - Useful options

## Install

via yarn

```bash
yarn add npm-prepare-dist --dev
```

via npm

```bash
npm install npm-prepare-dist --save-dev
```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
npm-prepare-dist
```

- Main `package.json` file will be copied into your **dist** folder
- devDependencies will be removed
- More _useless_ options will be removed
- `README.md` (and other files) will be copied into _dist_ folder as you wish

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { prepareDist } from 'npm-prepare-dist';

prepareDist('build', ['README.md', 'LICENSE', 'icon.svg'], './src/');
```

## Exapmle

Highly recommended to use as `postbuild` hook in you `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "postbuild": "npm-prepare-dist"
  }
}
```
